## Description:

The RTK (Roblox Tycoon Killer) project is an automation tool developed in Python, specially created for Tycoons players on Roblox. Its goal is to provide advanced automation functionality to perform repetitive tasks in Tycoons games, all without breaking Roblox rules or using APIs or exploits. RTK is designed to be a secure solution, avoiding any risk of being banned by Roblox.

## Main Features:

### Secure and Legitimate Automation
RTK was developed without the use of APIs or exploits, ensuring that all actions taken are 100% legitimate and in line with Roblox policies. This means that users can use RTK features without worrying about penalties or risk to their in-game profile, and this ensures that we will always be available for use regardless of roblox updates.

### Updates and New Features
Our commitment to continuous improvement is reflected through frequent RTK updates. Our development team is always hard at work implementing new features, improvements and bug fixes to ensure that users have access to the latest innovations in automation to maximize their efficiency in Tycoons.

### Quick .exe Run
 RTK is offered as an executable (.exe) application, which makes it quick and easy to run. With just one click, users have access to the powerful functionality of RTK, without the need for complex installations or complicated configurations.

### Unique and Powerful Features
 RTK offers a diverse set of features that are extremely useful for Tycoon players. Some of the main functions include Auto-Egg, Auto-Click, Anti-AFK, among others, which allow you to automate tedious tasks while you focus on something more productive away from the computer (or simply sleeping)

### Access to BETA Features
In addition to core features, RTK users have the exclusive opportunity to experience BETA features and functionality that are yet to be implemented in the future. This allows users to have early access to improvements and innovations under development, as well as contributing valuable feedback to the continuous improvement of the project.

### 100% Python
 RTK was developed completely in Python, a versatile and powerful programming language. This technological choice made it possible to create efficient and reliable software, ensuring that users have a fluid and safe experience when using the tool.

If you are an avid player of Tycoons on Roblox and want to increase your productivity and efficiency in the game, then RTK is an ideal choice. With frequent updates, powerful functionality, and full compliance with the Roblox rules, RTK is the ultimate tool for automating your repetitive tasks and achieving success in Tycoons safely and effectively.
