## version 1.1 (scheduled launch for: read the update above | codiname: harverst)

important note about the 1.1 update: the initial release of 8/11/23 cannot be fulfilled as I am improving and perfecting the program code in order to make it more stable and with less memory consumption, that said I will be postponing the release until the program is "complete", according to my estimates it will be ready by 08/20/2023, but this date may vary more or less, thank you for your cooperation

- improved beta GUI interface
- updated baf version V1.2 -> V1.5 (the framework has undergone numerous additions and improvements in the code making the new version essential in the use of future automations (old projects will not receive the new update)
- new locator implementations
- new beta function (farm maker)
- improved overall stability
- using configuration files to save farms
- addition of new locator modules (locator_song, multi_locator)
- farm maker now has advanced automation modes (dual_mode, notify mode)
- added error handling in "weak" parts of the code to prevent bugs in beta features
- the new configuration file (config.ini) has been completely revamped and improved to work without errors
- optimization of program imports

known issues: 

gui is creating extra blank screens for some reason.

additional notes:
this update had a total focus on farm maker in order to give more autonomy to users to create their own automations (basic knowledge of python required), in the next updates I intend to definitively implement the GUI and Farm maker, the locator function is complete , however I will leave it as a beta resource because the farm maker implements it uses BAF much better, I am scheduling at least one update per week, if you want to help you can contact me on discord, I am open to tips, advice and ideas :)

obs : i will make a little documentation for the RTK in the next weeks
